# Learn-Python

Introduction to Python: Absolute Beginner - Fundamentals : Build on your basic Python skills and dig into data structure basics.

**About this course:**
This course is part of the Microsoft Professional Program.

## Absolute Beginner

After you explore data types and variables, take a look at strings, input, testing, and formatting. From there, learn about arguments and parameters, along with conditionals and nested conditionals. By the end of the course, you’ll be able to create programs that prompt users for input and use conditional (True/False) logic and Python methods to manipulate numbers and text to provide responses to the users, in addition to requesting further input. Plus, learn basic troubleshooting for your code.

**What you'll learn:**

- Using Python in Jupyter Notebooks
- Gathering input and manipulating input/output
- Building reusable Functions with parameters and return values
- Decisions and repetition using conditional statements and loops


## Fundamentals

Focus on Python data structures, and work with string, list, and range sequences. Discover the power of list iteration, and learn about string and list methods. From there, get the details on file input and output—open files, read them, add to them, close them, and more. At the end of the course, you’ll be able to slice strings into substrings, create lists, iterate through them, import files, and use file append mode, along with a lot of other practical Python tasks, as you get started coding.

**What you'll learn:**

- Python 3 fundamentals
- Strings and List manipulation
- Methods to Iterate through strings, lists and ranges
- Creating, reading and writing to files

**Course Syllabus:**

- Module 1 - Sequences: String Indexing 
- Module 2 - Sequences: List Manipulation
- Module 3 - Sequences: Iteration
- Module 4 - Files: Input and Output
